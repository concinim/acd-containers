It provides turnkey annotators as well as highly customizable annotators that you can tune specifically for your application needs.  The Unified Medical Language System ([UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) is the primary source for concepts and medical codes. Annotator for Clinical Data can also work with user-provided ontologies beyond UMLS.  \n\nTo illustrate the basic function of Annotator for Clinical Data, let's look at a simple example.  Imagine that we have the following small snippet of text:\n\n```\nThere were no signs of ulceration\n```\n\nThe resulting concept over `ulceration` will contain medical codes along with contextual information about the concept (note in this example, the concept is negated):\n\n```\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C3887532\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Ulceration\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"patf\",\n    \"source\": \"umls\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.PathologicFunction\",\n    \"begin\": 23,\n    \"end\": 33,\n    \"coveredText\": \"ulceration\",\n    \"negated\": true,\n    \"nciCode\": \"C25757\",\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"263913002\",\n    \"vocabs\": \"MTH,NCI_CDISC,NCI_FDA,NCI,OMIM,SNOMEDCT_US,NCI_NCI-GLOSS\"\n}\n```\n\n## Data isolation\n\n### Public multi-tenant instances\n\n**User configuration data:** User configuration data is stored in Cloud Object Storage. This data is isolated by tenant at the service layer.\n\n**User unstructured text:** Requested analysis of unstructured text is processed in-memory. The input text is not persisted. Requests are isolated at the service layer.\n\n### Dedicated instances\n\n**User configuration data:** User configuration data is stored in Cloud Object Storage. This data is isolated at the service layer.\n\n**User unstructured text:** Requested analysis of unstructured text is processed in-memory. The input text is not persisted. Requests are isolated at the Kubernetes pod layer.\n\n## Compute isolation\n\n**Public multi-tenant instances:** The service is accessed via public endpoints. The service will access all dependencies via private endpoints. In these instances the control plane of the service is shared across tenants.\n\n**Dedicated instances:** The service can be accessed via public and/or private endpoints. Review [Public and private network endpoints](/about/overview/) for details. The service will access all dependencies via private endpoints. In these instances the control plane of the service is isolated in separate pods for each tenant.\n\n## Available annotators\n\nThe following annotators are available for detecting and coding medical concepts within unstructured data.\n\n### Attributes\n\nAttributes are higher order concepts composed of multiple pieces of information found in a document.  An example of this might be understanding if a patient is overweight or not.  Given some example text, we would like to know if the patient is overweight or not.\n\n```\nThe patient is a 37 year old male who is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs.\n```\n\nYou can create custom [concept values](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_value/) to extract and normalize the patient's height and weight.  With that information, you can create inference rules in Annotator for Clinical Data to combine that information into a single attribute that we'll call `NORMAL_WEIGHT`.  Custom attributes like this are a powerful way to distill unstructured text into actionable insights.\n\nFor more information, see [Attributes](/clouddocs/annotator_attribute_detection/).\n\n### Concepts\n\nThe concept annotator finds UMLS or custom concepts in unstructured text.\n\nFor more information, see [Concepts](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_detection/).\n\n### Concept value\n\nThe concept value annotator creates composite attributes resulting from a medical concept and an associated value.  It supports scalar values as well as value ranges.  \n\n```\nThe patient is a 37 year old male who is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs.\n```\n\nIn this example, the combination of `height` with `6 feet` is an example of how concept values work.\n\nFor more information, see [Concept Value](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_value/).\n\n## Contextual annotators\n\nContextual annotators use the surrounding context of the document to provide a deeper understanding of concepts.\n\n### Negation\n\nIdentifies spans of text with an implied negative meaning.  For example: _There were no signs of ulceration._\n\nFor more information, see [Negation](/clouddocs/annotator_negation_detection/).\n\n### Hypothetical\n\nIdentifies spans of text are the object of a hypothetical statement.  For example: _We discussed the pros and cons of chemotherapy._\n\nFor more information, see [Hypothetical](/clouddocs/annotator_hypothetical_detection/).\n\n### Concept disambiguation\n\nDetermines the validity of UMLS concepts detected in a document.\n\nFor more information, see [Disambiguation](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_disambiguation/).\n\n### Spell check\n\nMedically aware spell checker that can be integrated into an API call.\n\nFor more information, see [Spell Check](/clouddocs/annotator_spell_check/).\n\n### Turn-key annotators\n\n Annotator for Clinical Data provides a set of prebuilt annotators targeted at specific medical domains.\n\n* [Allergy](/clouddocs/annotator_allergy/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Cancer](/clouddocs/annotator_cancer/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Ejection fraction](/clouddocs/annotator_ejection_fraction/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Lab values](/clouddocs/annotator_lab_values)\n* [Living assistance](/clouddocs/annotator_living_assistance/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Medications](/clouddocs/annotator_medication/)\n* [Named entities](/clouddocs/annotator_named_entities/)\n* [Procedures](/clouddocs/annotator_procedure/)\n* [Sections](/clouddocs/annotator_sections/)\n* [Smoking](/clouddocs/annotator_smoking/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Symptoms & diseases](/clouddocs/annotator_symptom_disease/)\n\n### Clinical insights\n\nClinical insights are a collection of models and cartridge configuration that provide contextual information about key clinical attributes (medication, diagnosis, and procedure) for patient-centric clinical notes.\n\nFor more information, see [Clinical Insights](/clouddocs/clinical_insights_overview/).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e42b29c8242faf17e8369042d5a5cef2","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":269},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview","excerpt":"Overview.","categories":"Using ACD","slug":"overview","toc":true},"excerpt":"Overview.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Overview\"\nexcerpt: \"Overview.\"\ncategories: Using ACD\nslug: overview\ntoc: true\n---\n<!-- ---\n\ncopyright:\n  years: 2020\nlastupdated: \"2020-04-01\"\n\nkeywords: annotator clinical data, clinical data, annotation\n\nsubcollection: wh-acd\n\n--- -->\n\n<!-- # Overview -->\n\nAnnotator for Clinical Data is designed to find medical concepts, [medical codes](/clouddocs/medical_codes/), and contextual information in unstructured text.
